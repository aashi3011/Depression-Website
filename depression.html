      	<strong>This score shows You are depressed.</strong>
      	<br>
      	You have many symptoms of depression. Right now, the symptoms may be causing big problems in your daily life. It is probably very hard for you to take care of everyday activities and enjoy the things you usually do. You may even feel like you’re carrying a heavy weight that makes it almost impossible to get through your day.
        <br>
Take This Seriously
<br>
Even if you don't feel weighed down by your symptoms, try to do something about them as soon as possible. When you're feeling depressed, it can be hard to even do small things to take care of yourself. But you should call your doctor or a mental health professional today. And try to tell family and friends how you’re feeling.
How you're feeling now isn't how you'll always feel. People do get better. There are many good treatments for depression.
